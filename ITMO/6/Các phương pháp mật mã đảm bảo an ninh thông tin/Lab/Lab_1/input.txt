Is anyone as foolish as me? I create my own love story, only to end up hurting myself. Is anyone as foolish as me? Ignoring hundreds of paths, I choose to look in only one direction. I wish for just one chance to love you, to be near you, even if it means enduring pain because that is still better than a lifetime of regret. I would rather be a flower spreading its fragrance for you to pick than to wither away unnoticed.  That day, the sunlight shimmered so beautifully, and I couldnâ€™t help but be captivated by your clear eyes. That day, the rain fell, stinging my eyes, and yet, you stood beside me, warming my heart. Even if you have your own path to follow, I still wish to be the umbrella that shields you from the storm. Tomorrow, I will still love you, but I will keep it locked deep inside, a secret only I will ever know.
